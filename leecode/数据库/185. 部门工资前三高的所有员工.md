## 题目描述

Employee 表包含所有员工信息，每个员工有其对应的工号 Id，姓名 Name，工资 Salary 和部门编号 DepartmentId 。

```
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
```

Department 表包含公司所有部门的信息。

```
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
```

编写一个 SQL 查询，找出每个部门获得前三高工资的所有员工。例如，根据上述给定的表，查询结果应返回：

```
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
```

解释：

IT 部门中，Max 获得了最高的工资，Randy 和 Joe 都拿到了第二高的工资，Will 的工资排第三。销售部门（Sales）只有两名员工，Henry 的工资最高，Sam 的工资排第二。

## 数据表结构

```
CREATE TABLE `employee` (
  `Id` int(10) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT '主键id',
  `Salary` varchar(16) DEFAULT '' COMMENT '薪资',
  `Name` varchar(255) DEFAULT '' COMMENT '姓名',
  `DepartmentId` int(11) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT '部门id',
  PRIMARY KEY (`Id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=8 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COMMENT='雇员薪资表';

INSERT INTO `test`.`employee`(`Id`, `Salary`, `Name`, `DepartmentId`) VALUES (1, '85000', 'Joe', 1);
INSERT INTO `test`.`employee`(`Id`, `Salary`, `Name`, `DepartmentId`) VALUES (2, '80000', 'Henry', 2);
INSERT INTO `test`.`employee`(`Id`, `Salary`, `Name`, `DepartmentId`) VALUES (3, '60000', 'Sam', 2);
INSERT INTO `test`.`employee`(`Id`, `Salary`, `Name`, `DepartmentId`) VALUES (4, '90000', 'Max', 1);
INSERT INTO `test`.`employee`(`Id`, `Salary`, `Name`, `DepartmentId`) VALUES (5, '69000', 'Janet', 1);
INSERT INTO `test`.`employee`(`Id`, `Salary`, `Name`, `DepartmentId`) VALUES (6, '85000', 'Randy', 1);
INSERT INTO `test`.`employee`(`Id`, `Salary`, `Name`, `DepartmentId`) VALUES (7, '70000', 'Will', 1);

CREATE TABLE `department` (
  `Id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT '部门id',
  `Name` varchar(64) DEFAULT '' COMMENT '部门名称',
  PRIMARY KEY (`Id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=3 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COMMENT='部门表';

INSERT INTO `test`.`department`(`Id`, `Name`) VALUES (1, 'IT');
INSERT INTO `test`.`department`(`Id`, `Name`) VALUES (2, 'Sales');

```

## 问题解答

1. MySQL join + group by + 子查询 + if() + 变量

    ```
    select d.Name as Department, e.Name as Employee, e.Salary
    from employee as e
    join department as d on d.Id = e.DepartmentId
    join (
        select 
            DepartmentId, Salary, 
            if(@preDpId = DepartmentId, if(@Salary = Salary, @cnt, @cnt := @cnt + 1), @cnt := 1) as cnt,
            @preDpId := DepartmentId,
            @Salary := Salary
        from employee, (select @preDpId := null, @Salary := null, @cnt = 0) as tmp
        order by DepartmentId asc, Salary desc
    ) as tmp on tmp.DepartmentId = e.DepartmentId and tmp.Salary = e.Salary and tmp.cnt <= 3
    group by Employee
    -- order by Department asc, Salary desc
    
    ```
2. MySQL left join + 子查询 + group by + having

    ```
    select d.Name as Department,e.Name as Employee,e.Salary as Salary
    from Employee as e 
    left join Department as d on e.DepartmentId = d.Id
    where e.Id in
    (
        select e1.Id
        from Employee as e1 
        left join Employee as e2 on e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId and e1.Salary < e2.Salary
        group by e1.Id
        having count(distinct e2.Salary) <= 2
    )
    and e.DepartmentId in (select Id from Department)
    order by d.Id asc,e.Salary desc
    
    ```

3. MySQL inner join + 子查询

    ```
    SELECT P2.Name AS Department,P3.Name AS Employee,P3.Salary AS Salary
    FROM Employee AS P3
    INNER JOIN Department AS P2 ON P2.Id = P3.DepartmentId 
    WHERE (
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Salary)
        FROM Employee AS P4
        WHERE P3.DepartmentId = P4.DepartmentId AND P4.Salary >= P3.Salary
    ) <= 3
    ORDER BY DepartmentId,Salary DESC
    
    -- 同原理第二种方式
    SELECT d.NAME AS Department, e.NAME AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary 
    FROM employee AS e
    INNER JOIN department AS d ON e.DepartmentId = d.id 
    WHERE ( 
    	SELECT count(DISTINCT salary) 
    	FROM employee 
    	WHERE salary > e.salary AND departmentid = e.DepartmentId
    ) < 3 
    ORDER BY e.departmentid, Salary DESC
   
    ```
    注意：性能差。
    
4. MySQL 子查询 + dense_rank() + over()

    ```
    select Department, Employee, Salary
    from (
        select 
                d.Name as Department, e.Name as Employee, e.Salary as Salary, 
                dense_rank() over (partition by DepartmentId order by Salary desc) as rk
        from Employee as e, Department as d
        where e.DepartmentId = d.Id
    ) m
    where rk <= 3;
    
    ```
    注意：MySQL8.0支持窗口函数。
   
5. MySQL group by + having

    ```
    SELECT d. NAME AS Department, e2. NAME AS Employee, e2.Salary
    FROM Employee e1, Employee e2, Department d
    WHERE e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
    AND e1.Salary >= e2.Salary
    AND e2.DepartmentId = d.id
    GROUP BY e2.Salary, e2. NAME, Department
    HAVING count(DISTINCT e1.Salary) <= 3
    ORDER BY Department, e2.Salary DESC
    
    ```
