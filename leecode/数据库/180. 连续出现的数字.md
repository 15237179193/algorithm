## 题目描述

表：Logs

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```

id 是这个表的主键。

编写一个 SQL 查询，查找所有至少连续出现三次的数字。

返回的结果表中的数据可以按 任意顺序 排列。

查询结果格式如下面的例子所示：

Logs 表：

```
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
```

Result 表：

```
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
```

1 是唯一连续出现至少三次的数字。

## 数据表结构

```
CREATE TABLE `logs` (
  `Id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT '主键ID',
  `Num` varchar(16) DEFAULT '' COMMENT '次数',
  PRIMARY KEY (`Id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_general_ci COMMENT='日志记录表';


```

## 问题解答

1. MySQL if()

    ```
    select distinct ConsecutiveNums
    from (
        select 
            if(@preNum = Num, @nums := @nums + 1, @nums := 1) as nums, 
            @preNum := Num as ConsecutiveNums
        from logs as l, (select @nums := 0, @preNum := (select Num from logs limit 1)) as a
    ) as tmp
    where nums >= 3
   
   
   
    SELECT 
       distinct num as ConsecutiveNums 
    FROM
       (SELECT 
           num,
           @times := IF(@prenum = num , @times :=@times +1,1) as times,
           @prenum := num 
       FROM 
           logs, (
                   SELECT 
                       @prenum :=null, 
                       @times := 0
                   ) 
               as t
           ) as a  
    where 
       a.times > 2 
    
    ```
   
2. MySQL case when then else end

    ```
    select distinct Num as ConsecutiveNums
    from (
      select Num, 
        case 
          when @prev = Num then @count := @count + 1
          when (@prev := Num) is not null then @count := 1
        end as CNT
      from Logs, (select @prev := null,@count := null) as t
    ) as temp
    where temp.CNT >= 3
    
    ```
   
3. MySQL 自关联 + group by + having

    ```
    select distinct l1.num consecutivenums
    from logs l1 join logs l2
    on l1.num = l2.num and l1.id - l2.id between 0 and 2
    group by l1.id
    having count(l2.id) > 2
    
    ```
   
4. MySQL dense_rank() over() + group by + having

    ```
    select distinct Num as ConsecutiveNums
    from (
        select Num, abs(Id+1-(dense_rank() over(partition by Num  order by Id))) as temp 
      from Logs ) as t 
    group by Num, temp
    having count(temp ) >= 3
    
    ```

5. MySQL dense_rank() over()

    ```
    SELECT DISTINCT Num as ConsecutiveNums
    FROM(
        SELECT Id, Num,
        LAG(Num,1) OVER(ORDER BY Id) as last_1,
        LAG(Num,2) OVER(ORDER BY Id) as last_2
        FROM Logs
    ) as consecutivenum
    WHERE consecutivenum.Num = consecutivenum.last_1
    AND consecutivenum.last_1 = consecutivenum.last_2
    
    ```
